OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and accelerates the use of machine perception in commercial products. OpenCV supports a wide range of programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java, and is widely used for tasks like image processing, object detection, face recognition, and video analysis.

Key features of OpenCV include:
- Image and video I/O
- Image processing (filtering, transformations, color space conversion)
- Object detection and recognition
- Machine learning algorithms
- Real-time computer vision

OpenCV is popular in academia and industry due to its extensive documentation, active community, and ease of integration with other libraries and frameworks.
